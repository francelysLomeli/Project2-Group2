        <h5>Summary of Results from Usability Audit</h5>
        <p class="left-align">Users were asked about their experience using the IIT Student Portal. 
            The majority expressed negative feelings with responses ranging from “Hate it” to “Sometimes positive, 
            but hard to navigate” while a low number of students found it “good”. Subsequently, participants were asked “On a scale from 1-5, 
            how easy is it to assess your grade?”, where 1 represents “extremely difficult” and 5 indicates “extremely easy”. The sample mean was 2.9, 
            with a standard deviation of 0.83, suggesting a moderate level of likeability to the current interface (Chart 1).</p>

        <p class="left-align">Next, a yes or no question was asked, “Have you ever found a link that is not working”. 
            It was found that 70% of our sample encountered non-functioning links (Chart 2). </p>

        <p class="left-align">The question “How often do you use your Student Portal? (estimate times per week)” was asked. 
            The collected data demonstrated a heavy skew, the frequency of portal usage per week was a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 2.4. 
            However, what was interesting was that the median of the data was only 2. With the median being smaller than the mean, it further proves the data is 
            skewed to the left. From the skewness we can summarize that the majority of students don't visit their student portal throughout the week (Chart 3).</p>

        <p class="left-align">Next we asked, “Are there any improvements you would make to the Student Portal?”, 
            the answers ranged from, “Delete old links that aren't being used anymore and update UI so it's less tedious 
            to navigate through the different sections of the portal.”, “Not sure.”, “Make grades more clear (as a requirement 
            for teachers opposed to waiting the week of finals). Make academic resources up to date and forms easier to find”, 
            and “a grade calculator feature would be nice”. Finally, participants were asked to rate their satisfaction with the UI on a scale 
            from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating dissatisfaction and 5 indicating satisfaction. The mean was 2.3, with the standard deviation of 0.78. 
            From looking at the mean, we can conclude that students are generally dissatisfied with the current IIT Student Portal UI (Chart 4).

        <p class="left-align"> In the structured interviews, users expressed frustration with redundant links. 
            When navigating through the portal, most of the participants mentioned the lack of navigation pathways. 
            Participants found it difficult to know where to find a specific section. Many started feeling overwhelmed 
            by the abundance of options presented. Additionally, participants indicated the need for labeling of sections, 
            since many have to navigate through multiple menus or pages.</p>
